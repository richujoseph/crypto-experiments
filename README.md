# üîê Crypto Experiments

A comprehensive educational collection of cryptographic algorithms and techniques implemented in Java and C. This project demonstrates practical implementations of classical and modern cryptography, providing hands-on experience with encryption, decryption, hashing, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols.

## Overview

This repository serves as a practical resource for understanding core cryptographic concepts through implementation. Each program illustrates fundamental principles in cryptography, from classical ciphers to modern encryption standards and public-key infrastructure.

## Technologies & Algorithms

### Symmetric Encryption
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** - Modern symmetric encryption standard with configurable key sizes
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)** - Classic symmetric cipher demonstrating block cipher principles
- **RC4** - Stream cipher implementation for educational purposes

### Asymmetric Encryption
- **RSA** - Public-key cryptography system for secure communication and digital signatures

### Key Exchange
- **Diffie‚ÄìHellman** - Secure key exchange protocol enabling two parties to establish shared secrets over untrusted channels

### Classical Ciphers
- **Caesar Cipher** - Historical substitution cipher demonstrating basic encryption principles
- **Substitution Cipher** - General substitution cipher implementation

### Hashing & Authentication
- **Digital Signatures (DSA)** - Message authentication and non-repudiation techniques
- **XOR Hashing** - Fundamental hashing demonstration

## Getting Started
